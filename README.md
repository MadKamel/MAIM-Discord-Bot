# MAIM-Discord-Bot
MAIM is an obsolete Discord Bot, and the name stands for "Manwich Automated Infrastructure Management". It was used in my old raiding server, "Army of Manwich", before it was liquidated. The code in this archive is the latest version and may not contain some features as it did when it was in use.
